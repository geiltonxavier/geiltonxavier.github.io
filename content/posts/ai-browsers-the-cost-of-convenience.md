Have you ever wondered about the scope of having a browser with artificial intelligence inside?

From the outside, it sounds absolutely fantastic. An assistant always present, able to sum up pages, answer questions about what you are reading, help you formulate a well-crafted email, pull information here and there – all that, without closing your browser.

No effort, instant gratification. A perfect future, where everything is possible.

But there is a catch with that form of thinking that you are likely not considering.

To do all these things, any browser needs to see everything. And by everything I mean just that.

You browsed for the last week your bank account, read your personal email box, solved medical symptoms questions that gave you anxiety, all the while talking with your friends on sensitive topics.
