Hi! I'm a Brazilian Software Engineer with 15 years of experience, currently working as a Technical Lead at Siemens in Portugal.

I've spent my career designing cloud-native solutions, leading engineering teams, and helping organizations modernize their tech stack. Before Siemens, I worked with companies like Edenred, Fidelidade, and Prodesp, focusing on DevOps transformation, microservices adoption, and distributed systems architecture.

I'm deeply curious about how complex systems work at scale databases, distributed architectures, performance optimization, and the engineering principles that make software reliable and maintainable. I also enjoy mentoring engineers and sharing lessons learned from building systems that actually need to work.

Outside of work, I'm learning new languages (both human and programming ones), exploring how AI is reshaping software development and creativity.

I occasionally write about [engineering/career/life as a Brazilian dev abroad] here. If you moved to Portugal as a developer (or are thinking about it), you might find [this post](/posts/5-anos-em-portugal) interesting.

Feel free to reach out if you want to chat about distributed systems, career transitions, or anything in between.
