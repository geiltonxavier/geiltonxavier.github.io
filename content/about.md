Hi all, I’m a Brazilian Software Engineer and Technical Lead currently working at Siemens in Portugal, where I focus on designing and delivering scalable, cloud-native solutions. Over the years, I have led projects that modernized enterprise systems and helped teams adopt solid engineering practices around DevOps, microservices, and distributed architectures.

I started my career in 2010 and hold a strong foundation in computer science, with a deep interest in algorithms, distributed systems, databases, and system design. I enjoy exploring how complex systems work under the hood and how to make them more efficient, reliable, and maintainable.

Before joining Siemens, I worked on large-scale digital transformation projects in companies like Edenred, Fidelidade Seguros, and Prodesp, improving architecture, CI/CD, and engineering standards across teams.

Outside of work, I like learning new languages, playing guitar, and exploring how technology and AI are shaping the future of work and creativity.
